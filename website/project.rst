CMSC 35200 Project and Paper
----------------------------

The project and paper are an important part of the course. 
Students have to define and complete a project that covers some aspect of deep learning systems.
Based on their projects, students have to write a final paper evaluating the features and performance of their project.

Students may work alone or in teams of two or three.

**Some Potential Project Ideas**

We encourage students to propose their own ideas for projects. Here are a few ideas.

- DNN training and inference involve many vector and matrix operations. The performance achieved on a particular cocomputer thus depends critically on whether vector and matrix sizes are well aligned with the computer's memory architecture. A potential project would investigate how these factors effect performance on different computers, and how DNNs might be modified to increase performance.

- Nicolas Masse and colleagues propose `neuroscience-inspired approaches to avoid "catastrophic forgetting" in neural networks <http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01569v1>`_. A potential project might apply these techniques in other contexts and evaluate their performance.

- Xing Lin and colleagues describe `All-Optical Machine Learning Using [3-D printed] Diffractive Deep Neural Networks <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.08711.pdf>`_. It would be a fun project to experiment with these techniques. However, you will need access to a THz radiation source.
