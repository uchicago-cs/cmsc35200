<h2>Course description<a class="headerlink" href="#course-description" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Deep learning is emerging as a major technique for solving problems in a variety of fields, including computer vision, personalized medicine, autonomous vehicles, and natural language processing. Critical to success in these target domains is the development of learning systems: deep learning frameworks that support the tasks of learning complex models and inferencing with those models, and targeting many devices including CPUs, GPUs, mobile device, edge devices, computer clusters, and scalable parallel systems. The systematic study of how to build and optimize such systems is an active area of research.</p>
<p>This course is aimed as an introduction to this topic. We will cover various aspects of deep learning systems, including: basics of deep learning, programming models for expressing machine learning models, automatic differentiation methods used to compute gradients for training, memory optimization, scheduling, data and model parallel and distributed learning, hardware acceleration, domain specific languages, workflows for large-scale machine learning including hyper parameter optimization and uncertainty quantification, and training data and model serving. Many of these topics intersect with existing research directions in databases, systems and networking, architecture, and programming languages. The goal is to present a comprehensive picture of how current deep learning systems work, discuss and explore research opportunities for extending and building on existing frameworks, and deep dive into the accelerators being developed by numerous startups to address the performance needs of the machine learning community.</p>
<p>We will split out time between concepts and practice, with a typical week having one lecture on a specific aspect of deep learning systems and one lab/discussion session in which technologies such as Keras, Tensorflow, CNTK, Mxnet, and PyTorch are used to address that specific aspect. Some guest lectures may cover emerging computer architectures for next generation deep learning accelerators.</p>
<p>Specific topics to be covered:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Introduction to deep learning models</li>
<li>Functional content of deep learning frameworks</li>
<li>Software architecture and design of frameworks</li>
<li>Abstraction layers for deep learning</li>
<li>Performance and benchmarking deep learning systems</li>
<li>Hardware architectures for accelerating deep learning</li>
<li>Parallelism (model, data, ensemble)</li>
<li>Portable representations and translations of models</li>
<li>Optimization for training, inference</li>
<li>Workflows for machine learning and workflow tools</li>
<li>Hyper-parameter optimization and ensembles</li>
<li>Uncertainty quantification</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the quarter, students will:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Understand the purpose of deep learning systems.</li>
<li>Be able to use common deep learning tools such as Keras, TensorFlow, and PyTorch</li>
<li>Understand major challenges in efficient deep learning and how those challenges are addressed in different systems.</li>
<li>Have basic knowledge of research challenges in deep learning system design and implementation.</li>
</ol>
<p>This course will also provide useful background for students wishing to take our Spring 2019 class, <strong>CMSC 35350-1: Neuromorphic Computing</strong>.</p>

<h2>Course organization<a class="headerlink" href="#course-organization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This course is divided into three components:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Lectures</strong>: The Monday and Wednesday lectures will present technical material on deep learning systems.</li>
<li><strong>Programming Assignments</strong>: Four short programming assignments will be given throughout the quarter.</li>
<li><strong>Project and Paper</strong>: Students have to define and complete a project that covers some aspect of deep learning systems. Based on their projects, students have to write a final paper evaluating the features and performance of their project. See <a class="reference external" href="project.html">Project and Paper</a> for more information.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Grading<a class="headerlink" href="#grading" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The final grade will be divided as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>30% for the four programming assignments</li>
<li>40% project</li>
<li>20% final paper</li>
<li>10% class participation</li>
</ul>
<p>There will be no midterms or final exam.</p>
<div class="section" id="policy-on-academic-honesty">
<h3>Policy on academic honesty<a class="headerlink" href="#policy-on-academic-honesty" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The University of Chicago has a <a class="reference external" href="http://college.uchicago.edu/advising/academic-integrity-student-conduct">formal policy on academic honesty</a>
that you are expected to adhere to.</p>
<p>In brief, academic dishonesty (handing in someone else’s work as your
own, taking existing code and not citing its origin, etc.) will <em>not</em> be
tolerated in this course. Depending on the severity of the offense, you
risk getting a hefty point penalty or being dismissed altogether from
the course. All occurrences of academic dishonesty will furthermore be
referred to the Dean of Students office, which may impose further
penalties, including suspension and expulsion.</p>
<p>Even so, discussing the concepts necessary to complete the programming assignments and the project is
certainly allowed (and encouraged). Under <em>no circumstances</em> should you
show (or email) another student your code or post your solution to a
web-page or social media site. If you have discussed parts of an
assignment with someone else, then make sure to say so in your
submission (e.g., in a README file or as a comment at the top of your
source code file). If you consulted other sources, please make sure you
cite these sources.</p>
<p>Finally, if you have any questions regarding what would or would not be
considered academic dishonesty in this course, please don’t hesitate to
ask the instructor.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="asking-questions">
<h3>Asking questions<a class="headerlink" href="#asking-questions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The preferred form of support for this course is through <em>Piazza</em>
(<a class="reference external" href="http://www.piazza.com/">http://www.piazza.com/</a>), an on-line discussion service which can be
used to ask questions and share useful information with your classmates.
Students will be enrolled in Piazza at the start of the quarter.</p>
<p>All questions regarding assignments or material covered in class must be
sent to Piazza, and not directly to the instructors, as this
allows your classmates to join in the discussion and benefit from the
replies to your question. If you send a message directly to the
instructor, you will get a gentle reminder that your question
should be asked on Piazza.</p>
<p>Piazza has a mechanism that allows you to ask a private question, which
will be seen only by the instructors and teaching assistants. This
mechanism should be used <em>only</em> for questions that require revealing
part of your solution to an assignment.</p>
<p>Piazza also allows students to post anonymously. <em>Anonymous posts will
be ignored</em> (you will also get a gentle reminder asking you to not post
anonymously). You are expected to feel
comfortable sharing your questions and thoughts with your classmates
without hiding behind a veil of anonymity.</p>
<p>Additionally, all course announcements will be made through Piazza. It
is your responsibility to check Piazza often to see if there are any
announcements. Please note that you can configure your Piazza account to
send you e-mail notifications every time there is a new post on Piazza.
Just go to your Account Settings, then to Class Settings, click on “Edit
Notifications” under CMSC 35200. We encourage you to select either the
“Real Time” option (get a notification as soon as there are new posts)
or the “Smart Digest” option (get a summary of all the posts sent over
the last 1-6 hours – you can select the frequency).</p>
