CMSC 35200 Project and Paper
----------------------------

The project and paper are an important part of the course. 
You have to define and complete a project that covers some aspect of deep learning systems.
Based on your project, you have to write a final paper evaluating its features and performance.

Students may work alone or in teams of two or three.

**Schedule** (subject to change)

* *October 17*: Initial project proposal due--one page writeup of project goal, research plan, proposed outcome(s). Your instructors will provide feedback.

* *October 24*: Final project proposal due, refined based on feedback.

* *November 14*: Mid-quarter project report. 2-3 pages summarizing progress, any problems encountered, and any changes to project direction or scope.

* *December 1 and 3*: Project presentations

* *December 8*: Papers due. 8-10 pages in `ACM Conference Proceedings format (sigconf) <https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template>`_. 


**Some Potential Project Ideas**

We encourage students to propose their own ideas for projects. Here are a few ideas.

- DNN training and inference involve many vector and matrix operations. The performance achieved on a particular cocomputer thus depends critically on whether vector and matrix sizes are well aligned with the computer's memory architecture. A potential project would investigate how these factors effect performance on different computers, and how DNNs might be modified to increase performance.

- Nicolas Masse and colleagues propose `neuroscience-inspired approaches to avoid "catastrophic forgetting" in neural networks <http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01569v1>`_. A potential project might apply these techniques in other contexts and evaluate their performance.

- Implement, evaluate, and document programs on Cerebras, SambaNova, and/or GraphCore
