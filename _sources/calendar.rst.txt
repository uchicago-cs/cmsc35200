Week 1: Motivation and Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Monday, October 1**: Introduction to Deep Learning Models

The slides presented in class will soon be here.

Important things to do:

- Sign up for `Google Collaboratory <https://colab.research.google.com>`_, which we will use to run examples. 
- Read Chapters 1 and 2 of `Deep Learning with Python <http://www.deeplearningitalia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Dropbox_Chollet.pdf>`_ by Francois Chollet.
- Work through the Python code examples in Chapter 2 of Chollet. Those in Section 2.1 are to be found `here <https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks/blob/master/2.1-a-first-look-at-a-neural-network.ipynb>`_. (From within Google Collaboratory, select File then Upload notebook, then Git, and give the URL `https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks.git <https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks.git>`_.) Those in subsequent subsections you'll need to type in yourself.

**Wednesday, October 3**: Functional Content of Deep Learning Frameworks

- Read `Tensorflow: a system for large-scale machine learning <https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/osdi16/osdi16-abadi.pdf>`_, Abadi, Mart√≠n, Paul Barham, Jianmin Chen, Zhifeng Chen, Andy Davis, Jeffrey Dean, Matthieu Devin et al. OSDI, vol. 16, pp. 265-283. 2016.

*Suggested Reading*.
Note: Some of these readings go into topics that we will cover later in the quarter.
As such, you may not get that much out of reading these references at the start
of the quarter. Instead, they can be good reference material to re-read later on
and see how everything fits together.

- `Deep Learning <https://www.deeplearningbook.org>`_, Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville. MIT Press and online. 
- `Neural Networks and Deep Learning <http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com>`_, Michael Neilsen. A particularly nice presentation of back propagation.
- `Cloud Computing for Science and Engineering <https://cloud4scieng.org>`_, Ian Foster and Dennis Gannon. MIT Press and online. Describes how to use deep learning services provided by Amazon, Google, and Microsoft.
