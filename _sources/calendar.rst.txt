- `Deep Learning with Python <https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-with-python-703e26853820>`_. Brief tutorial.
- `Tensorflow: a system for large-scale machine learning <https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/osdi16/osdi16-abadi.pdf>`_, Abadi, Mart√≠n, Paul Barham, Jianmin Chen, Zhifeng Chen, Andy Davis, Jeffrey Dean, Matthieu Devin et al. OSDI, vol. 16, pp. 265-283. 2016.

*Suggested Reading*.
Note: Some of these readings go into topics that we will cover later in the quarter.
As such, you may not get that much out of reading these references at the start
of the quarter. Instead, they can be good reference material to re-read later on
and see how everything fits together.

- `Deep Learning <https://www.deeplearningbook.org>`_, Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville. MIT Press and online. 
- `Deep Learning with Python <http://www.deeplearningitalia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Dropbox_Chollet.pdf>`_, Francois Chollet. Manning Publications, 2017. Introduces DL via Keras and Python. There is an `online forum <https://forums.manning.com/forums/deep-learning-with-python>`_.
- `Neural Networks and Deep Learning <http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com>`_, Michael Neilsen. A particularly nice presentation of back propagation.
- `Cloud Computing for Science and Engineering <https://cloud4scieng.org>`_, Ian Foster and Dennis Gannon. Describes how to use deep learning services provided by Amazon, Google, and Microsoft.
