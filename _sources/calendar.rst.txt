No required reading for this week. We will be covering basic terminology and

**Suggested Reading**

Note: Some of these readings go into topics that we will cover later in the quarter.
As such, you may not get that much out of reading these references at the start
of the quarter. Instead, they can be good reference material to re-read later on
and see how everything fits together.
