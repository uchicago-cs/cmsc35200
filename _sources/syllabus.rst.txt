Course organization
-------------------

This course is divided into three components:

* **Reading and Discussion of Primary Sources**: Several papers will be assigned each week, to be discussed on both Tuesday and Thursday.
* **Programming Assignments**: Two short programming assignments will be given throughout the quarter.
* **Project and Paper**: Students will have to implement a distributed system drawing upon the seminal work covered in the class discussions. Based on their projects, students will have to write a final paper evaluating the features and performance of their project.


Course Schedule
---------------

See `Calendar and Reading List <calendar.html>`_.


Grading
-------

The final grade will be divided as follows:  

* 25% programming assignments (broken down into 10%, 15%)

* 35% participation in discussions, broken down into:

  * 15%: In-class participation
  * 10%: Piazza participation
  * 10%: Participation in *The Observers*
  
  See below for a detailed rubric for each of these components.
  
* 20% project

* 20% final paper

There will be no midterms or final exam. 

The "in-class participation" grade is an individual grade, scored out of 10:
 
* 10: Student participates consistently in all or most class discussions, even when part of *The Observers*.
* 9: Student participates consistently in all or most class discussions.
* 8: Student has actively participated in class discussions, but participation has not been consistent (e.g., very active in one discussion, completely silent in another)
* 7: Student has participated in class discussions, but falls below expectations.
* 0: Student has not participated in any class discussions.

The "Piazza participation" grade is an individual grade, mostly based on participation when the student is part of *The Questioners*. It is scored out of 10:
 
* 10: Student is consistently active on Piazza, not just contributing good questions when the student's group is *The Questioners* but also writing/answering posts outside his/her group.
* 9: Student consistently contributes good questions, but is only active on Piazza when his/her group is *The Questioners*.
* 8: Student has contributed questions or written/answered posts, but participation has not been consistent (e.g., very active one week, completely silent in another)
* 7: Student has contributed questions or written/answered posts, but falls below expectations.
* 0: Student has not written any meaningful posts or comments on Piazza.

The "Participation in *The Observers*" grade is a *group* grade. A grade is assigned to the entire group whenever their role is *The Observers*, and the final grade is the average of those grades. Each student in the group gets the same grade. It is scored out of 10:

* 10: Discussion log is detailed and well-written, and the group has supplemented it with external references (not limited to the suggested reading for that week) and/or provided answers to questions that were left unanswered during the discussion.
* 9: Discussion log is detailed, divided into concrete sections, and well-written. The group has gone beyond just presenting their raw notes from the discussion, and has put some effort into polishing up the notes. Someone who has not attended the discussion or even read the paper would get the gist of what was discussed that week.
* 8: Discussion log accurately reflects the structure and content of the discussion, but it is closer to a collection of notes than a polished account of the discussion. Someone who attended the discussion would find it useful to recall what was discussed, but someone who did not could find it hard to parse.
* 7: The discussion log reflects some, but not all, of the discussion. It lacks structure and is composed of a collection of unpolished notes.
* Any discussion logs worse than a 7 will receive a 0.


Types of grades
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Students may take this course for a quality grade (a “letter” grade) or a pass/fail grade. By default, we assume students are taking the class for a quality grade. We will honor all requests to withdraw or take the class pass/fail *before* the final paper is due.


Policy on academic honesty
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The University of Chicago has a `formal policy on academic honesty <http://college.uchicago.edu/advising/academic-integrity-student-conduct>`_
that you are expected to adhere to.

In brief, academic dishonesty (handing in someone else’s work as your
own, taking existing code and not citing its origin, etc.) will *not* be
tolerated in this course. Depending on the severity of the offense, you
risk getting a hefty point penalty or being dismissed altogether from
the course. All occurrences of academic dishonesty will furthermore be
referred to the Dean of Students office, which may impose further
penalties, including suspension and expulsion.

Even so, discussing the concepts necessary to complete the programming assignments and the project is
certainly allowed (and encouraged). Under *no circumstances* should you
show (or email) another student your code or post your solution to a
web-page or social media site. If you have discussed parts of an
assignment with someone else, then make sure to say so in your
submission (e.g., in a README file or as a comment at the top of your
source code file). If you consulted other sources, please make sure you
cite these sources.

Finally, if you have any questions regarding what would or would not be
considered academic dishonesty in this course, please don’t hesitate to
ask the instructor.

Asking questions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The preferred form of support for this course is through *Piazza*
(http://www.piazza.com/), an on-line discussion service which can be
used to ask questions and share useful information with your classmates.
Students will be enrolled in Piazza at the start of the quarter.

All questions regarding assignments or material covered in class must be
sent to Piazza, and not directly to the instructors or TAs, as this
allows your classmates to join in the discussion and benefit from the
replies to your question. If you send a message directly to the
instructor or the TAs, you will get a gentle reminder that your question
should be asked on Piazza.

Piazza has a mechanism that allows you to ask a private question, which
will be seen only by the instructors and teaching assistants. This
mechanism should be used *only* for questions that require revealing
part of your solution to an assignment.

Piazza also allows students to post anonymously. *Anonymous posts will
be ignored* (you will also get a gentle reminder asking you to not post
anonymously). This is a majors-level course: you are expected to feel
comfortable sharing your questions and thoughts with your classmates
without hiding behind a veil of anonymity.

Additionally, all course announcements will be made through Piazza. It
is your responsibility to check Piazza often to see if there are any
announcements. Please note that you can configure your Piazza account to
send you e-mail notifications every time there is a new post on Piazza.
Just go to your Account Settings, then to Class Settings, click on "Edit
Notifications" under CMSC 23310. We encourage you to select either the
"Real Time" option (get a notification as soon as there are new posts)
or the "Smart Digest" option (get a summary of all the posts sent over
the last 1-6 hours – you can select the frequency).
