Policy on academic honesty
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The University of Chicago has a `formal policy on academic honesty <http://college.uchicago.edu/advising/academic-integrity-student-conduct>`_
that you are expected to adhere to.

In brief, academic dishonesty (handing in someone else’s work as your
own, taking existing code and not citing its origin, etc.) will *not* be
tolerated in this course. Depending on the severity of the offense, you
risk getting a hefty point penalty or being dismissed altogether from
the course. All occurrences of academic dishonesty will furthermore be
referred to the Dean of Students office, which may impose further
penalties, including suspension and expulsion.

Even so, discussing the concepts necessary to complete the programming assignments and the project is
certainly allowed (and encouraged). Under *no circumstances* should you
show (or email) another student your code or post your solution to a
web-page or social media site. If you have discussed parts of an
assignment with someone else, then make sure to say so in your
submission (e.g., in a README file or as a comment at the top of your
source code file). If you consulted other sources, please make sure you
cite these sources.

Finally, if you have any questions regarding what would or would not be
considered academic dishonesty in this course, please don’t hesitate to
ask the instructor.

Asking questions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The preferred form of support for this course is through *Piazza*
(http://www.piazza.com/), an on-line discussion service which can be
used to ask questions and share useful information with your classmates.
Students will be enrolled in Piazza at the start of the quarter.

All questions regarding assignments or material covered in class must be
sent to Piazza, and not directly to the instructors, as this
allows your classmates to join in the discussion and benefit from the
replies to your question. If you send a message directly to the
instructor, you will get a gentle reminder that your question
should be asked on Piazza.

Piazza has a mechanism that allows you to ask a private question, which
will be seen only by the instructors and teaching assistants. This
mechanism should be used *only* for questions that require revealing
part of your solution to an assignment.

Piazza also allows students to post anonymously. *Anonymous posts will
be ignored* (you will also get a gentle reminder asking you to not post
anonymously). You are expected to feel
comfortable sharing your questions and thoughts with your classmates
without hiding behind a veil of anonymity.

Additionally, all course announcements will be made through Piazza. It
is your responsibility to check Piazza often to see if there are any
announcements. Please note that you can configure your Piazza account to
send you e-mail notifications every time there is a new post on Piazza.
Just go to your Account Settings, then to Class Settings, click on "Edit
Notifications" under CMSC 35200. We encourage you to select either the
"Real Time" option (get a notification as soon as there are new posts)
or the "Smart Digest" option (get a summary of all the posts sent over
the last 1-6 hours – you can select the frequency).
